# Vault.nvim

I love [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim), but I am a enthusiast to rewrite everything myself. After looking up dictionary for a similar word to `leap`, I decide this toy should be named after `vault.nvim`.

This plugin copies a lot of idea from [see easymotion code](https://github.com/vim-scripts/EasyMotion/blob/master/autoload/EasyMotion.vim), but in `Lua`.
